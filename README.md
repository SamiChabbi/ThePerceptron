## Description

This project implements a perceptron for binary classification. It loads a dataset of images containing cats and other objects, normalizes the data, trains the perceptron, and evaluates its performance on a test set. The code is well-commented to explain each step of the process.

## How to Use

1. Ensure you have the required libraries installed (NumPy, Matplotlib, h5py).
2. Run the `perceptron.ipynb` notebook in a Jupyter Notebook environment or any other Python environment.

## Files

- `perceptron.ipynb`: The main Jupyter notebook containing code, comments, and explanatory plots.
- `perceptron.py`: A Python file containing the perceptron implementation as a class.
- `main.py`: An example demonstrating how to use the perceptron class in a main application.
- `datasets/`: Folder containing the datasets (not included in the GitHub repository).

## Highlights

- The code uses vectorization to enhance performance and understanding.
- Plots are generated to visualize the cost evolution over iterations.
- The model is evaluated on a test set to measure its performance.
- Detailed comments in the code provide in-depth explanations.

## Achievements

- Developed a perceptron from scratch for binary classification.
- Demonstrated understanding of core machine learning concepts.
- Implemented vectorization for improved computational efficiency.
- Generated informative plots for visualization of the training process.

## Next Steps

- Explore and experiment with different datasets and model architectures.
- Further optimize and extend the perceptron for more complex tasks.
- Continue learning and applying machine learning principles.
